# Tal Dagore plus Rivermoor Interkingdom Event

Known World War. Again one of the bigger events of the year definitely recommend if you can only go to two. We will definitely be looking at carpooling options. This event typically has a lot of battle games (like 5-6 a day typically though the schedule has not been announced yet), a great site thats got good bathrooms, meals provided for most meals, a night quest etc etc.
